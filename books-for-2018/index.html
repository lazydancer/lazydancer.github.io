    <h1>Books for 2018</h1>

    <p>My goal is to read 52 books this year. Follow me on this post to see what books I am reading

    <h2>Currently reading</h2>

    <ul>

        <li><a href="#"><b>Code</b> <i> by Charles Petzold</i></a>
        <li><a href="#"><b>Fabless</b> <i>by Paul McLellan</i></a>
    </ul>

    <h2>Complete</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><a href=""><b>Prelude to Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i></a><p>
        	This is my 6th Asimov book. This story follows Hari Seldon in the creation
            of pychohistory while providing more information of Trantor, the center
            of the Empire. With knowledge of the previous 5 books, this is the first
            book that goes back to before the first book. I feel each of Asimov's books
            trys to focus on a central theme. I have so far enjoyed the order
            I have read the books and I would recommend this after reading the main series.
        </li>
    	<li><a href=""><b>What Money Can't Buy</b> <i>by Michael J. Sandel</i></a><p>
    		I find economics to be a tool to see secondary effects of actions. This book extends even further into moral questions. A few that stood out to me were; betting on death (life insurance), paying kids for good grades and classroom advertising. The book showed how creating a market changed the morally of each.  
        		
        </li>
        <li><a href="#"><b>Forward the Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i></a><p>
            The last of the Asimov books I have read. This was the final book after the Prelude to Foundatoin and the one before Foundation. I enjoyed this book with it further look into the First Foundation and the creation of the Second Foundation. I found it to be less eventful than the books that follow it. I would recommend this book, just not the first one you read in the series.
        </li>
        <li><a href="#"><b>On Writing</b> <i> by Stephen King</i></a>
            <p>On Writing was not directed at me, I don't aspire to write fiction books. I feel I can use a few of the lessons that he talked about in a more general sense. 1. Tell the Truth, if in your writing you are holding back then you can not create a connection to the reader. 2. Don't use adverbs or the passive tense, I will try my best. 3. Be be a good writer you need to read a lot. I feel the last point really can apply to many professions, in software engineering, I will be trying to read more code avaiable open source
