    <h2>Currently reading</h2>

    <ul>

        <li><a href="#"><b>Forward the Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i></a>

    <h2>Complete</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><a href=""><b>Prelude to Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i></a><p>
        	This is my 6th Asimov book. This story follows Hari Seldon in the creation of pychohistory while providing more information of Trantor, the center of the Empire. With knowledge of the previous 5 books, this is the first book that goes back to before the first book. I feel each of Asimov's books trys to focus on a central theme. I have so far enjoyed the order I have read the books and I would recommend this after reading the main series.
        </li>
    	<li><a href=""><b>What Money Can't Buy</b> <i>by Michael J. Sandel</i></a><p>
    		I find economics to be a tool to see secondary effects of actions. This book extends even further into moral questions. A few that stood out to me were; betting on death (life insurance), paying kids for good grades and classroom advertising. The book showed how creating a market changed the morally of each.
