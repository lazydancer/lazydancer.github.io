    <ol>

        <li><b>Prelude to Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
        	The story follows Hari Seldon in the creation
            of pychohistory while providing more information of Trantor, the center
            of the Empire. With knowledge of the previous 5 books, this is the first
            book that goes back to before the first book. I have so far enjoyed the order
            I read the books and would recommend this after reading the main series.
        </li>
    	<li><b>What Money Can't Buy</b> <i>by Michael J. Sandel</i><p>
            This book is about the moral questions of buying and selling stuff. 
            Should we bet on death (life insurance), paying kids for good 
            grades and classroom advertising. 
            The book showed how creating a market changed the morally of each.
            Am I betting that I will get in a car crash when I buy
            car insurance?
        </li>
        <li><b>Forward the Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
            This will be the final book from the Foundation series, not counting robots and other ones.
            With the further look into the First Foundation and the creation of the Second Foundation.
            We were able to get more detail of the First Foundation and the Second Foundation. I love
            how well these books tied together. I have enjoyed The Foundation Series and would recommend to read
        </li>
        <li><b>On Writing</b> <i> by Stephen King</i><p>
            On Writing was not directed at me, but here are a few things that can be applied generally.
            1. Tell the Truth, if in your writing you are holding back then you can not create a connection to the reader. 
            2. Don't use adverbs or the passive tense, I will try my best. 
            3. To be a good writer, you need to read a lot. 
            I feel the last point really can apply to many professions, in software engineering, reading other people code
            and doing it a lot.
        </li>
        <li><b>Code</b> <i> by Charles Petzold</i><p>
            After the first few chapters, I expected this book to a math book on the 
            theory of programming and a part of it was. The majority of this book was practical and went on how a computer
            is designed and built from telephone relays to a high level computer language. I would recommend this to
            anybody who uses a computer. This helps take the "magic" element out of them.
        </li>
        <li><b>Fabless</b> <i>by Paul McLellan</i><p>
            An interesting book on the semiconductor industry. When starting this
            book I was expecting more deep dive into the technical aspects of the industry but was more of a history book.
            I felt some of the "In there own words" sections where just repeating
            what the author said in the chapter leading up to the excerpt.
         </li>
         <li><b>Howard Hughes</b> <i>by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele</i><p>
            I didn't know anything about Howard Hughes before reading this book.
            It is interesting how much he did with this life being a movie producer, record breaking pilot, airplane designer
            to name a few. This book had so much detail on Hugh's actions and it was an interesting perspective from Hugh's associates.
            With the addtion of more people and the detail which was available made a for a long book and I would recommend reading.
        </li>
        <li><b>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</b> <i>by Philip K. Dick</i><p>
            The book creates an atmosphere of post-apocalyptic 2020 San Francisco which I seem to get lost in.
            It is the book's 50th anniversary. It is interesting how it seems futuristic still. It brings up the question
            what is the difference between an android and a human. 
        </li>
         <li><b>The Mythical Man-Month</b> <i>by Fred Brooks</i><p>
            This book came out 40 years ago, other then the talk of mainframe computers, I feel this book has held up its 
            principles still. The central principle being, adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
            Maybe this could be we greatly underestimate the time needed to learn a new system and the time that is
            added when there is more people that need to be informed.
        </li>
        <li><b>Ant Encounters</b> <i>by Deborah Gordon</i><p>
            There is so much information about ants and this book seems to be an introduction to the wider field of how
            living things interact. It is interesting that with no central control, ants are able to live though the rate
            in which they interact and the pattern of their encounters. I would recommend this book, it was a nice quick read.
        </li>
        <li><b>The Man in the High Castle</b> <i>by Philip K. Dick</i><p>
            This book looks at what would have happened if World War II ended differently. The story takes place in the US with
            from many different perspectives. These perspectives were changed in the middle of page. This made some time to reorient
            oneself each jump. The main focus was an author who wrote a book showing an alternate history of that if the allies won
            WWII. I really enjoyed this book, and like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep looked agian at what is real and what is fake,
            is there any difference from the two and does it matter.
        </li>
        <li><b>Man's Search for Meaning</b> <i>by Viktor Frankl</i><p>
            Viktor Frankl writes about experiences as an Auschwitz concentration camp inmate during World War II. This was an emotional
            book to read, when looking at what happened in the concentration camps. Frankl looks at this from a phycologist perspective 
            and the later section of the books presents his psychotherapeutic method. I would recommend this book
        </li>
        <li><b>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</b> <i>by Ben Horowitz</i><p>
            This book is about Ben Horowitz experiences as a CEO of many startup companies and he outlines his experiences.
            I try to avoid business books as they seem to be more about selling books then writing a story. This I would
            not catergorize as a business book and closer to an auto-biography. Horowitz goes into detail of the hard
            decisions he had to make and offers advice to new CEO. It offers an in-depth look in to the world of fast
            growing technology companies.
        </li>
        <li><b>Evicted</b> <i>by Matthew Desmond</i><p>
            One of the best non-fiction books I've read. The book follows half a dozen families and their stuggles.
            At the same time, it shows the larger picture with the facts of evictions in the usa and the impact it has.
            It was enlightining to have the landlord's perpective of this enviroment, bringing up the discussion of explotation and
            housing being a fundamental human need. I would recommend this book.
        </li>
        <li><b>Made in America</b> <i>by Sam Walton</i><p>
            This autobiography by Sam Walton recounts the history of Wal-Mart. I enjoyed reading about the transition from 
            many specialized shops to general stores we know today.
            Learning about Sam Walton and his obsession with retail, from his first stores to the discount stores in 
            rural america. He was extremely competitive and trying out things that haven't be done before. At the same time 
            taking best practices from his competitors. I feel like a lot from this book and would recommend it.
        </li>
        <li><b>Enlightenment Now</b> <i>by Steven Pinker</i><p>
            This was a long book. I read Part I and II but had to abandon it half way though Part III. This book made me think
            differently about how well we are doing in the world. I really enjoyed the chapter on climate change, in how 
            Pinker goes over how we have taken the news and how it has also been a political issue and how there are divided.
            It was also interesting to see how the news warps our image of the world and he re-enforces the availiblity bias
            and confirmation bias. I would recommend the first two parts to anyone, the last part I found way to acidemic to generalize
            what was seen in the first two parts and involves a lot of "-ism"s
        </li>
        <li><b>A Wrinkle in Time</b> <i>by Madeleine L'Engle</i><p>
            A fun weird little story
        </li>
        <li><b>Code Complete 2</b> <i>by Steve McConnell</i><p>
            I have been focusing to improving my programming skills. From reviews online, I heard this was the textbook for programmers.
            I believe it lived up to the hype, many guidelines it recommends I use everyday. I liked that this book went into detail of many
            elements of project management which can be used out of programming. Refering to past studies and data when necessary. Some of the
            book seemed out dated but most held up well for being updated a decade ago
        </li>
        <li><b>Fight Club</b> <i>Chuck Palahniuk</i><p>
            From the fight club movie, I have had a love hate relationship the movie. First I loved it because of my personality.
            Then I hated it because it was a movie sponsered by Pepsi and was like any other movie. Now, I have the mixed feeling
            about the story it was a very interesting analysis of the human psycheo. The movie follows the books very closely expect
            for ending which leave the movie and book with different a message at the end of the book.
        </li>
        <li><b>Le Petit Nicolas</b> <i>René Goscinny</i><p>
            Un livre de jeunesse que j'ai lu pour améliorer mon français.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck</b> <i>by Mark Manson</i><p>
            It is an okay book. My  favorite part of the book is how when
            you remove actions and challenges each of us has core values and you have to strive for maintaining these values. It is
            interesting when you compare this book his "Models" books. It seems like this book is just a more generalized and less
            actual actionable recommendations. This book had a wierd feeling to me where I enjoyed the self-reflectiveness but I would
            not recommend this book as it feels like an inspiration piece
        
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Debt: The First 5000 Years</b> <i>by David Graeber</i><p>
            This was a insightful book that brought up many new ideas. The barter economy
            never existed. Describing the market economy and human economy. 
            This book was lonng and read like a textbook. It 
            provides a very detailed account of the introduction of money and worth and the different systems that were used until
            today.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>I, Robot</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
            I, Robot is a  story about when robots came be able to talk and perform a larger variety of tasks. Each chapter seemed to introduce
            a new and exciting problem which made you think about the ethics of robots and how they relate to people. 
        </li>
            
        <li><b>Fooled by Randomness</b> <i>by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</i><p>
            This book was a great book to look at how bad humans are at guessing the future.
            In addition the book looked at the bias everyone has and how they apply in the real world
