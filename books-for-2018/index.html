    <h1>Books for 2018</h1>

    <p>My goal is to read 52 books this year. Below are reviews of the books I have read so far.

    <h2>Currently reading</h2>

    <ul>

        <li><b>Code</b> <i> by Charles Petzold</i>
        <li><b>Fabless</b> <i>by Paul McLellan</i>
    </ul>

    <h2>Complete</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><b>Prelude to Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
        	This is my 6th book from the Foundation Series. The story follows Hari Seldon in the creation
            of pychohistory while providing more information of Trantor, the center
            of the Empire. With knowledge of the previous 5 books, this is the first
            book that goes back to before the first book. I have so far enjoyed the order
            I read the books and would recommend this after reading the main series.
        </li>
    	<li><b>What Money Can't Buy</b> <i>by Michael J. Sandel</i><p>
            This book is about the moral questions of buying and selling stuff. 
            Should we bet on death (life insurance), paying kids for good 
            grades and classroom advertising. 
            The book showed how creating a market changed the morally of each.
            Am I betting that I will get in a car crash when I buy
            car insurance?
        </li>
        <li><b>Forward the Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
            This will be the final book from the Foundatoin series, not counting robots and other ones.
            With the further look into the First Foundation and the creation of the Second Foundation.
            We were able to get more detail of the First Foundatoin and the Secondn Foundation. I love
            how well tied these books are together. I have enjoyed the foundatoin series and would recommend to read
        </li>
        <li><b>On Writing</b> <i> by Stephen King</i><p>
            On Writing was not directed at me, but here are a few things that can be applied generally.
            1. Tell the Truth, if in your writing you are holding back then you can not create a connection to the reader. 
            2. Don't use adverbs or the passive tense, I will try my best. 
            3. To be a good writer, you need to read a lot. 
            I feel the last point really can apply to many professions, in software engineering, reading other people code
            and doing it a lot.
            
    </ol>
