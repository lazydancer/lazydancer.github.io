    <h1>Books for 2018</h1>

    <p>My goal is to read 52 books this year. Below are reviews of the books I have read so far.

    <h2>Currently reading</h2>

    <ul>
        
           
          <li><b>Code Complete 2</b> <i>by Steve McConnell</i>
    </ul>

    <h2>Complete</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><b>Prelude to Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
        	The story follows Hari Seldon in the creation
            of pychohistory while providing more information of Trantor, the center
            of the Empire. With knowledge of the previous 5 books, this is the first
            book that goes back to before the first book. I have so far enjoyed the order
            I read the books and would recommend this after reading the main series.
        </li>
    	<li><b>What Money Can't Buy</b> <i>by Michael J. Sandel</i><p>
            This book is about the moral questions of buying and selling stuff. 
            Should we bet on death (life insurance), paying kids for good 
            grades and classroom advertising. 
            The book showed how creating a market changed the morally of each.
            Am I betting that I will get in a car crash when I buy
            car insurance?
        </li>
        <li><b>Forward the Foundation</b> <i>by Isaac Asimov</i><p>
            This will be the final book from the Foundatoin series, not counting robots and other ones.
            With the further look into the First Foundation and the creation of the Second Foundation.
            We were able to get more detail of the First Foundatoin and the Secondn Foundation. I love
            how well tied these books are together. I have enjoyed the foundatoin series and would recommend to read
        </li>
        <li><b>On Writing</b> <i> by Stephen King</i><p>
            On Writing was not directed at me, but here are a few things that can be applied generally.
            1. Tell the Truth, if in your writing you are holding back then you can not create a connection to the reader. 
            2. Don't use adverbs or the passive tense, I will try my best. 
            3. To be a good writer, you need to read a lot. 
            I feel the last point really can apply to many professions, in software engineering, reading other people code
            and doing it a lot.
        </li>
        <li><b>Code</b> <i> by Charles Petzold</i><p>
            After the first few chapters, I expected this book to a math book on the 
            theory of programming and a part of it was. The majority of this book was practical and went on how a computer
            is designed and built from telephone relays to a high level computer language. I would recommend this to
            anybody who uses a computer. This helps take the "magic" element out of them.
        </li>
        <li><b>Fabless</b> <i>by Paul McLellan</i><p>
            An interesting book on the semiconductor industry and I learnt more than I knew before When starting this
            book I was expecting more deep dive into the technical aspects of the industry but was more a history book.
            I felt some of the "In there own words" sections where just repeating
            what the authour said in the chapter leading up to the excerpt.
         </li>
         <li><b>Howard Hughes</b> <i>by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele</i><p>
            I didn't know anything about Howard Hughes before reading this book.
            It is interesting how much he did with this life being a movie producer, record breaking pilot, airplane designer
            to name a few. This book had so much detail on Hugh's actions and it was an interesting perspective from Hugh's associates.
            With the addtion of more people and the detail which was available made a for a long book and I would recommend reading.
        </li>
        <li><b>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</b> <i>by Philip K. Dick</i><p>
            The book creates an atmosphere of post-apocalyptic 2020 San Francisco which I seem to get lost in.
            It is the book's 50th anniversary. It is interesting how it seems futuristic still.
