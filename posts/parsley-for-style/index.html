<h1>Parsley for Style</h1>

<p>Parsley for Style is an app in development to reduce the amount of time it takes to prepare food. Promoting healthy eating by reducing barriers to starting cooking.<a style="padding-left:7px;" href="https://github.com/lazydancer/Parsley-for-Style">GitHub &raquo;</a></p>

<p>This was my first Django app, using a web framework built on top of Python. Although not the prettiest interface I've ever designed, it had the ability to sign up users and keep a list of user choices</p>

<p>The site was hosted on AWS and used elastic beanstalk service - with EC2 servers, load balancing and S3 for static data. The database, also hosted on AWS as an RDS instance runs a Postgres database and allows flexibility to develop the app further. </p>
