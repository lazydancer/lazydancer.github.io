<h1>Altitude</h1>

<p>Altitude is a time-budgeting app making you more productive.<a style="padding-left:7px;" href="https://github.com/lazydancer/altitude">Github Â»</a></p>

<p>In this project I used React, Redux and Electron. After starting this project in Angular, I changed my path to React. I found Angular to be too rigid and I got to a point where I couldn't add anything except the most simple actions. I tried Redux, I would recommend not using it to start a new project. It adds more complexity while not offsetting the benefits.</p>

<p>Electron was an interesting test and I would use it in the future. It is great to have the same environment over all operating systems and writing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
