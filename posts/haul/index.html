<h1 id="title">haul: Route Planner for EVE Online</h1>

<p>
    I built <strong>haul</strong> (Hyperspace Asset Unloading and Loading)
    because EVE really is spreadsheets in space, and apparently my reaction to
    that joke was to make a better spreadsheet. The game is just an excuse; the
    real fun was gluing together a route planner that could out-nerd me when I am
    tired and still in love with the tooling.
</p>

<p>
    What started as a weekend experiment with a shortest-path library turned
    into a playground for the parts of engineering I enjoy: modelling messy
    systems, caching everything that moves, and feeding a frontend with data it
    never expected. This write-up walks through the bits of haul that still make
    me grin when I open the repo.
</p>

<h2>Making the map behave</h2>

<p>
    The core of haul is a navigation graph that refuses to stay abstract. I let
    the <code>NavigationGraph</code> class soak up ship quirks, warp curves, and
    my personal collection of "don't go there" systems. Instead of
    showing raw distances, each edge is weighted by how it feels to fly it. Once
    the graph learns those preferences I cache the resulting paths so the server
    can answer questions instantly, even when I am spamming route requests out of
    curiosity.
</p>

<p>
    Working on this layer was equal parts math and playing whack-a-mole with
    weird EVE map data. Stations that share a grid needed custom rules, stargate
    hops deserved their own timing, and I slipped in logging that reads like a
    travel diary when a route surprises me. It is how I test new ideas: change a
    weight, watch the logs, tweak again.
</p>

<h2>Keeping the pipes lively</h2>
<p>
    The backend leans on FastAPI because I wanted something snappy while I
    experimented. Asynchronous calls pull market orders, solar-system metadata,
    and whatever else the ESI API lets me touch that week. An asyncio pipeline
    cleans that firehose: filter by cargo space, sanity-check prices, hand the
    survivors to the pathfinder, and push the results over server-sent events to
    React. If a good trade appears, the UI lights up without a single manual
    refresh.
</p>

<p>
    I wrote a Rust sidecar for the hot path just to see if it would help, and it
    stayed because the latency drop was obvious the second the market API started
    sulking. More importantly, the rewrite forced me to tighten the data model so
    the Python and Rust halves share exactly the same shape. The Rust service now
    sits beside the main app, ready to take over whenever I want to stress-test
    the pipeline.
</p>

<h2>Letting the code pick favourites</h2>
<p>
    My favourite loop lives in the pathfinder. It takes noisy trade matches,
    filters out anything the graph cannot reach, asks how long the detour would
    really take, and quietly throws away the ones that turn a profit only in my
    imagination. The trimmed version looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def pathfinder(order_matches, graph, ship):
    order_matches = filter_order_matches_not_in_graph(order_matches, graph)
    order_matches = filter_order_matches_same_region(order_matches, graph)
    order_matches = calculate_net_profit(order_matches, graph, ship)
    return [match for match in order_matches if match.net_profit and match.net_profit > 0]
</code></pre>

<p>
    It is small, but it captures everything I wanted from haul: code that
    quietly handles the bookkeeping so I can geek out about the next tweak. When
    the logger announces that only three trades survived the gauntlet, I know the
    tool did the thinking for me.
</p>

<p>
    There is still plenty I want to play with--automated risk-map updates, a
    fully Rust backend, maybe live route rewrites when markets drift--but the
    current build already scratches the itch that started the project. haul is my
    favourite kind of side project: the game stays a backdrop while the code gets
    to be the main act.
</p>

<h2>For the nerds</h2>
<p>
    I like EVE because everything in space has to be built by someone, but I
    love haul because it let me fiddle with that ecosystem on my terms. This was
    never the path to infinite ISK; it was an excuse to automate away the boring
    bits and keep the crunchy decisions.
</p>

<p>
    I flew a Sunesis almost exclusively for these runs. Low-volume, high-value
    loot made more sense than hauling mountains of tritanium, so most nights were
    spent sweeping the regions around The Forge and quietly feeding Jita. Fire
    sales were my favourite targets. Some players would sell items at low prices 
    and haul would flag them before the market bots woke up. I tuned
    for align time and warp speed, then bolted on just enough armour to shrug off
    the stray smart bombs that would have vaporized a lesser frigate. Two-second
    align, roughly seven AU per second, about seven hundred cubic metres of cargo
    space: nerd stats, but they mattered.
</p>

<p>
    Risk calculations mixed whatever I was carrying with how sketchy the route
    felt. The classic choice between Jita and Amarr was either the spicy five
    minute sprint through Ahbazon or the sensible fifteen minute detour. With
    twenty million ISK in the hold I usually gambled; with two hundred million I
    let the planner nudge me toward the scenic route.
</p>

<p>
    I kept mostly to high-sec, dipped into low-sec when the rewards
    were silly, and only daydreamed about null-sec after reading killmails that
    told me I would not make it home. On the rare occasions I needed to move a
    freighter's worth of items, PushX got the contract. There is something
    thrilling about watching a courier move everything you own while your
    monitoring script quietly refreshes in the background.
</p>

<p>
    So yes, the theme was always the same: move everything to Jita, but do it
    with enough automation that the space spreadsheets finally felt like play.
</p>
