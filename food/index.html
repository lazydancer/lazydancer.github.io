    <h1>Food</h1>   

    <p>food is an application built to help the planning phase of cooking. The hardest part of cooking is the prep. I wanted an app that made it easy to select a recipe and build a grocery list</p>

    <p>You can find the code and more info on github. In this article I will go behind the scenes to show what this application is running. This was the first time I built a Django Application, so I will post things I learned on the way</p>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Django </li>
        <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
        <li>Postgres + SQLite3</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Django</h2>

    <p>This my first time making an app in Django. Python is one of my favorite programming languages and this was fun. 

    <h2>AWS</h2>

    <p>AWS runs this site as an S3 bucket. This app uses the power avaiable though this service much better. Setting up an Elastic Beanstalk App. THis automatically starts a EC2 server and Load balancing. </p>

    <h2>Postgres + SQLite3</h2>

    <p>THe postgres server also runs on AWS. This is overkill for this application as at this point it could be deliveried through a static site but this always flexiblity. I would like to add user lists and being able to upload your our recipes. 

    <p>On the local machine side for testing SQLite3 server is setup. THis was for people who want to try the app out without starting an Postgres database.</p>
