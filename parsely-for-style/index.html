    <p>Parsely for Style is an app development in-progress to reduce the amount of time it takes to prepare food. There are three main features that </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Simple recipes, start with less than 5 ingredient recipes.</li>
      <li>Substitue Ingredients, being able to substitue a variety of ingredients that make sense</li>
      <li>Feedback, offering recommendations of recipes from previously made recipes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Django </li>
        <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Django</h2>

    <p>This my first time making an app in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. Python is one of my favorite programming languages and this was fun and will try it for other apps in the future

    <h2>AWS</h2>

    <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> runs this site as an S3 bucket. This app uses the power avaiable though this service much better. Setting up an Elastic Beanstalk App. THis automatically starts a EC2 server and Load balancing. </p>

    <h2>Postgres + SQLite3</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> database runs RDS on AWS, this allows flexiblity to develop the app further. </p>
